Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My name is Richard and I have discovered coding, web development and web design as a result of having much more free time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This project is a mock design company.

I have 4 different pages, a landing page (index.html), a products page, which contains information on products and services (products.html), an About Us/ About Me page, with information about this mock company, and our background. Finally, a contact page (contact.html) with different contact methods for this mock company. 

With further development and training, I would love to, one day, be able to design websites for companies, such as this mock company. 

Also included as the accompanying CSS and SCSS files, adding design and flair, to this project.
